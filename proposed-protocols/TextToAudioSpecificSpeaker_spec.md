# Text To Audio with Specific Speaker

## Goal

The goal of text-to-audio conversion with a specific speaker is to generate high-quality, natural-sounding audio that replicates the chosen speaker's voice accurately. The audio should capture the speaker's unique tone, pitch, pace, and accent while ensuring the content is delivered fluently and engagingly.

## Evaluation

Responses will be evaluated by human reviewers and automated scoring systems to ensure high-quality, natural, and accurate audio generation

Additional automated scoring criteria:

### Human Evaluation Criteria:

- Accuracy: The audio must match the provided text exactly, with no omissions, additions, or misinterpretations.
- Fluency: The speech must sound natural and smooth, without awkward pauses, mispronunciations, or robotic delivery.
- Speaker Authenticity: The generated audio should closely replicate the specified speaker's voice, including tone, pitch, pace, and unique characteristics.

### Automated Scoring Criteria:

- WER (Word Error Rate): Measures the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to match the audio transcript with the original text.
- Pitch and Intonation Matching: Analyzes the generated audio's pitch and intonation patterns to ensure they align with the target speaker's characteristics.
- Spectral Similarity: Compares the acoustic features of the generated audio with reference samples of the target speaker.
- Emotion Alignment Score: Evaluates how well the emotional tone in the audio matches the intended emotion conveyed in the text.
- Pronunciation Accuracy: Uses phonetic analysis to verify the correct pronunciation of words, especially in multilingual scenarios.

## Actions

### `text-to-speech()`

- **Params**:

  - `voice_id` (_string_, optional): Voice ID to be used.
  - `text` (_string_): The text that will get converted into speech..
  - `model_id` (_string_, optional): The model ID to be used.
  - `language_code` (_string_, optional): The language code of the text.
  - `voice_settings` (_object_, optional): Additional parameters such as tone, pitch, pace, or accent.

- **Returns**:
