## Specifications

The specification is maintained as a Markdown file. There are three important sections:

1. [Overview](/docs/OVERVIEW.md) - A high level overview of the protocol.
2. [Contracts](/contracts) - Solidity smart contracts defining token distribution mechanism
3. [Discussions](https://github.com/Forest-Protocols/protocols/discussions) - A forum where new proposals to change the specification are discussed.
